 alright this is the log ill be using to document my coding process so far ,

up until now, i have completed: 

importing an image onto the screen: 

dabbled  first into matplotlib and started manually plotting coordinates  - big waste of time as it was tedious
then i started to use the pygame module because it is a better option - i couldnt find a way to implement pathfinding using matplotlib without an exessive use of mathematics 
to find out graphs- it would have to be highly accurate for a single path from the apron to the runway 
 


plotting coordinates into the same screen - initially used matplot lib for this and then changed to pygame and drawed circles - better option to use pygame 
i have plotted apron points, checkpoints (holding point son the runway) and runway poinjtsw (where the plane takes off)
used a list for this and outputterd the list in pygame  


now i am currently working on pathfinding and the movement of objects from the apron to the runways: 

right now i have used a yt video to help with understanding the ins and outs of pathfinding, of course comparing the 2 different pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra and A*)
which perfectly fits my purpose of the code
initally followed the code to see how they did it initially and then tweaked and implemented similar methodologies into my code #
understood about using the matrix and mapping the binary digits into the matrix to allow the object to move past of block the object

things that i am stuck on NOW (6/10/25): 
i have no idea on how to make the matrix/ grid fit the dimensions of my image - i have heard on the .transform metod but i dont think it will work 
solved problem - changed to pixel shift from 32 to 8 - made it easier for mapping and folowing the paths on the image and have finished the  2D grid to only focus on terminal 5 







i really need to finish pathfinding because once it is finished, i can then work on the voice prompts; using the ICAO handbook to thingy the voice prompts to simulate basic asss commands 
bcs once pathfinding is done, everythings falls through 
bcs during junctions, i can make the plane stop and the user can voice their inputs to guide the plane throught the holding points. 

entry 6/1/26 - still stuck on the same thing - have NO idea what going on how to do it and such 



i have sucessgfully done so and so now its object moveing alonghtat luine
